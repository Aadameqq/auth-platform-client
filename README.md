# Auth Platform

A hobby project focused on building a flexible authentication and authorization platform for web and mobile applications. This repository includes modules for user login, registration, session management, and integration with external identity providers (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, etc.). The main goal is to experiment with security solutions and learn about modern authentication standards.

## What’s included?

- REST API endpoints for user registration and login
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support for improved security
- Integration with popular external identity providers (OAuth2)
- Session and JWT token management
- Codebase structured for easy modifications and extensions

## Repository structure

- **auth-platform-api** — Backend REST API (see [auth-platform](https://github.com/Aadameqq/auth-platform-api))
- **auth-platform-client** — Client-side web application (this repository)
